# PHP Rules

## General Coding Standards:
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards for consistent code formatting.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or constants instead.
- Write clean and reusable code with proper error handling and logging.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.

## Performance Optimization:
- Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary operations or loops.
- Use caching mechanisms where applicable to improve response times.

## Security Best Practices:
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use prepared statements or ORM tools to interact with the database securely.
- Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
